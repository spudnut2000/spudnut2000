# -- Notice --
I do not use Github for most of my own projects anymore, in protest to Micosoft using gihub data to train their AI. I host my own private Gitea instead, which can be found Here: [https://git.bellsworne.tech](https://git.bellsworne.tech)

I still ocassionaly interact with other public repositories, and may host things like nix flakes or other dotfiles.
